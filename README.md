## Usage
In most good software, pasting text that has been copied with the `unselectable` option will not paste notes and references. However, in others, such as the Office suite, it won't work. You must therefore use the `hidden` option before copying the text.

## To-do
- Blocklist / Whitelist
- An "hidden only when the text is selected" option
